<p>Ad Riesige Auswahl an CDs Vinyl und MP3s. Learned from the madness of many tab book. Basically Animals as Leaders have transitioned from being a band capable of touring with After the Burial to an act more equivalent to Intervals style which in my opinion is quite a large. Im a music researcher who feels that AAL is worth discussing more in collegiate academic settings. The Madness Of Many is the latest full-length from Animals As Leaders released on November 11th 2016 through Sumerian Records US.
