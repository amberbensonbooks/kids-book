<p>In my childhood I was known as the boy whose mother had run off with an Englishman. The human story is universal. All the Lives We Never Lived is Myshkins story about how he came to terms with his past.</p>
<h3 id="a-novel-at-amazonae">A Novel at Amazonae.</h3><p>All the Lives We Never Lived is basically a slow period drama. The overlap of history and fiction is the best part of this novel. All The Lives We Never Lived is about freedom the ruins of war misplaced ideologies and love. A paean to motherhood and loss in India Anuradha Roy sets family drama against the national drama of Indian. All the lives we never lived. This book about halfway through began to remind me of Donna Tartts The Goldfinch in the way that the story of a mother who is really only briefly actually present in either of the books is told by their sons sick with longing ofr their presence and their maternal love.</p>
