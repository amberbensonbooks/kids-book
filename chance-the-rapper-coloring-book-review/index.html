<p>Gospel choirs are the backbone of the LP rocketing skyward in the background the same way soul samples did on Kanye records James Brown. The future is bright for Chance the Rapper. The success of 2013s Acid Rap has quickly become somewhat of an industry legend.</p>
<h3 id="acid-rap-s-goal-was-to-show-the-world-who-chance-the-rapper-was-and-now-that-we-know-him-he-wants-nothing-more-than-for-us-all-to-celebrate-together">Acid Rap s goal was to show the world who Chance The Rapper was and now that we know him he wants nothing more than for us all to celebrate together.</h3><p>Brimming with clever wordplay brilliant delivery and an overall sense of pulsating. Chance however masters this technique effortlessly as Coloring Book is actually enhanced by the presence of religion because it provides a definitive theme without going overboard. With Chances personal redemption at the fore its abundantly clear that Coloring Book is a gospel album first and a hip hop album second even if Finish Line. Still coloring outside the lines. Album opener All We Got proclaims This for the kids of the King of kingsThis is the holiest thingThis is the beat that played under the words The second verse finds Chance talking about church I get my word from the sermon avoiding the devil I do not talk to the serpentThats holistic discernment. This is a very messy often disjointed work with a clear secondary-material quality.</p>
