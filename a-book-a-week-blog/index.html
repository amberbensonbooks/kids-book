<p>As a way to keep track of this goal I created this blog. Your brain is always churning on new ideas looking for new distinctions it can make. Even insanely busy and succesful people like Warren Buffet Elon Musk Bill Gates Tim Ferriss Ryan Holiday MAKE time to read. Every day you pour in more ideas which your brain must find a way to integrate into your existing knowledge base. A blog has its own reasons for being and blogs do not aspire to become books if they are truly written as blogs.
