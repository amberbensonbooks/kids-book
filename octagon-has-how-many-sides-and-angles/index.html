<p>If a polygon has 5 sides, it will have 5 interior angles. How many sides does an octagon have? An octagon is a polygon that has eight sides.</p>
<h3 id="an-039octagon039-is-a-particular-kind-of-polygon">An �octagon� is a particular kind of polygon.</h3><p>Since it is regular then all interior angles are the same. An octagon has 8 sides. Thus, as it has got 8 sides and angles, the vertices and the number of edges will also be 8. A regular 8 sided octagon has no acute angles but has 8 equal obtuse angle of 135 degrees that add up to 1080 degrees An octagon has eight sides. There are no right angles in an octagon.</p>

<p>Given the length of a side a, the span s is. The word derives from the greek words okto meaning eight and gonia meaning angle. in many countries throughout the world, an example of an octagon seen in everyday life is the red stop sign. We will review the octagon definition, discuss the octagon angles and how they affect the octagon shape. Thus each exterior angle is 1080/8 = 135 degrees. An octagon has eight sides which is five more than a triangle, so we need to add the results of 5 x 180 degrees to the triangle�s 180 degrees: (9) Shapes, Sides and Vertices Version 2 Jack Hartmann.</p>

<p>An octagon has 8 angles because it has 8. The angles of a pentagon add up to 540 degrees. The sum of interior angles is 1080 degrees. In an irregular pentagon, pentagon sides and angles can be different sizes. In a regular pentagon, its interior angles are 108 degrees and its exterior angles are 72 degrees.

<p>An octagon has 8 sides. An octagon has 8 angles because it has 8. Interior angles of 135° exterior angles of 45° area = 2(1+√2)s 2, or approximately 4.828427 × s 2 (where s=side length) width w = (1+√2)s; That means the number of vertices is 8 and the number of edges is 8.

<p>A pentagon has 5 sides and 5 angles. Needless to say, an octagon has 8 angles. Sum of all the interior angles of a polygon is equal to the product of a straight angle and two less than the number of sides of the polygon. Interior angles of 135° exterior angles of 45° area = 2(1+√2)s 2, or approximately 4.828427 × s 2 (where s=side length) width w = (1+√2)s; In a regular polygon, all the interior angles measure the same and hence can be obtained by dividing the sum of the interior angles by the number.
