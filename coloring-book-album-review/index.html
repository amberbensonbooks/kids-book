<p>B O O K M A N. Gospel choirs are the backbone of the LP rocketing skyward in the background the same way soul samples did on Kanye records James Brown. Coloring Book is the richest hip hop album of 2016 so far. At first I was disappointed with the album but with A LOT more listens this weekend and seeing a lot of praise about the album outside this sub I LOVE this album. It is not intended as an uncritical endorsement nor is it an examination of the spiritual benefits or dangers of listening to hip-hop more generally.
