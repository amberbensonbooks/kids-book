<p>Am I Still a Big Sister. I like that this book is more about the baby a few months down the road when life has settled down some but is still a little bit different than what it was before. Read as many books as you like Personal use and Join Over 150000 Happy Readers. It mentions that babies cry a lot but focuses on the childs ability to help figure out why.
