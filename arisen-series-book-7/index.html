<p>Book 7 of the series was not just as full on as the series has been so far. 47 out of 5 stars. He is best known and most beloved for his ribald profane merciless and generally hilarious insults quips and bon mots which are so characteristic that listeners have affectionately dubbed them. Ever since Master Gunnery Sergeant Fick came blitzing out of nowhere in Maximum Violence Arisen book 4 he has emerged as the closest thing to a consensus fan favorite character for the series. Quote Aaliyah or more commonly referred to as Ali plays a pivotal role as ALPHA teams sniper and some say shes the last best sniper in the world ALPHA Team were headed to North Korea on a covert mission when the 1111 attacks happened in Britain making them turn around and head back to Hereford and the days following the world started to fall.
