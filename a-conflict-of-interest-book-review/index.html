<p>Trent is a partner at the new firm and grew up in the same town as Avery. An odd word perhaps to describe a book that centers on the kidnapping of a six year old girl but the book is written with such compassion such empathy and ultimately the unshakable belief that love is all around us. The characters were flat and the storyline was extremely dull and the writing was very amateur. The first half of the book reads like a tutorial on the operation of a big-city law firm. He was also aware that he was to return his review within two weeks. Book Review The Priory Of The Orange Tree By Samantha Shannon Book Review Fantasy Novel Book Blogger.</p>
