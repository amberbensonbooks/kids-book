<p>Chance the Rappers Coloring Book is one of the strongest rap albums released this year an uplifting mix of spiritual and grounded that even an atheist can catch the Spirit to. All We Got Feat. No surface noise high quality vinyl and i m really glad chance s team took the time to press these mixtapes on 45 rpm because the dynamics are amazing on both this and acid rap coloring book gets the bigger benefit though thanks to its grand. Coloring Book is a really nice step forward for Chance I do think that this album does still have some weak moments and goes on for way too long with a weaker second half but I do think there is some enjoyment to be had here and still leaves me with hope that perhaps Chance has it in him to make a remarkable project. Blessings Hook - Jamila Woods Chance The Rapper Im gon praise him praise him till Im gone Im gon praise him praise him till Im gone When the praises go up the blessings come down When the praises go up the blessings come down It seems like blessings keep falling in my lap It seems like blessings keep falling in my lap Verse 1 - Chance The Rapper I dont make.
