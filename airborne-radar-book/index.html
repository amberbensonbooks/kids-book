<p>An airborne early warning and control AEWC system is an airborne radar picket system designed to detect aircraft ships vehicles missiles and other incoming projectiles at long ranges and perform command and control of the battlespace in an air engagement by directing fighter and attack aircraft strikes. Airborne radar systems can provide high sensitivity and finely resolved vertical profiles to characterize precipitation microphysics for the benefit of model parameterizations and process understanding eg Reinhart et al 2014. This book discusses methods for measuring the water surface backscattering signature and estimating the near-surface wind vector over water using airborne radars in addition to their standard application.
