<p>Hamilton does a very good job with the story of Alexander the Great. The book Alexander the Great throws light on the achievements of the great conqueror on one hand and on the other hand provides a very thorough insight upon the great statured personae of the famous king. There is something remarkable about the process of conquering territory. In case youre the kind of person who likes to peek at the answers at the back of the math book my choice is Robin Lane Foxs book. Through all his victories and conquests he has become a great hero and has had a large impact on history.

<p>That is why I chose he book Alexander the Great by JR. Alexander the Great also explores the great conquerors death still an unexplained mystery One account gives Alexanders death a verdict of murder and the other of a complicated natural death The author gives a detailed account of the subjects last days. The book is written in easy language with a lot of anecdotes which make for entertaining reading. Get the book here. It has many pictures and is more like a text or reference book.
