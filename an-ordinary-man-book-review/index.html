<p>An Ordinary Man In An Ordinary World by Martin McGregor 255 Rating details 11 ratings 4 reviews I have seen more in 41 years of life than some people would see in many lifetimes. An engraving of Napoleon based on a drawing by a British army captain stationed on Saint Helena 1820. This review is available to non-members for a limited time. Besides being an incredible story of survival a measure of luck and the success one man who is in the moral right can have against a world gone mad it is an excellently written book. An Ordinary Man makes clear that the most famous hero of the Rwandan genocide survived above all because of his strength of character and his capitalist wits. Pin On Books Of Influence.</p>
