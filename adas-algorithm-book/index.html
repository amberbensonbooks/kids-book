<p>This Webinar introduces the audience to the challenges of implementing and deploying ADAS across a vehicle. So far in this account of Essigners book Ive missed out the heart of the story - Adas Algorithm which is to do with her deep insights into how Babbages Analytical Engine which would be controlled by a punch card system could be put to almost any task and her understanding in particular of how it could compute Bernoulli numbers. This book is a long-awaited biography for Ada whose ideas could have changed the world had the world allowed her the opportunity.</p>
